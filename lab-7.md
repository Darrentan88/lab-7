# Lab 07: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to
find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do 
for this lab is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists 
of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first 
page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly 
ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your 
own master usability checklist.

## Individual Deliverables To Basecamp:

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

2. https://www.heurio.co/nielsens-10-usability-heuristics 

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Navigation: Is the website or app easy to navigate? Are menus and buttons intuitive and easy to understand?
2. Consistency: Is the design consistent throughout the website or app? Are colors, fonts, and styles consistent across all pages?
3. Error prevention: Are there any potential errors that could occur during the user's journey? Are there clear error messages and instructions on how to correct errors?
4. Clear labeling: Are labels clear and easy to understand? Are terms used consistently throughout the website or app?
5. Readability: Is the text easy to read? Is there enough contrast between the text and the background?
6. Accessibility: Is the website or app accessible to all users, including those with disabilities? Does it meet WCAG 2.1 standards?
7. Load time: Does the website or app load quickly? Are images optimized and files compressed to improve loading speed?
8. Mobile responsiveness: Is the website or app optimized for mobile devices? Does it have a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes?
9. User feedback: Is there a way for users to provide feedback on their experience with the website or app? Are feedback forms or surveys easy to find and use?
10. User testing: Has the website or app been tested with real users to ensure its usability? Was feedback incorporated into the design to improve the user experience?
